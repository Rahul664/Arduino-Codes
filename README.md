1. Stepper Motor.
   
This folder contains a simple code to run the [uni-polar stepper motor from Digikey](https://www.adafruit.com/product/858?gQT=1).
[L293D Motor Driver](https://www.digikey.com/short/f9rbw3nz) and [external battery](https://www.digikey.com/short/vb0hcbm7) source is required to run the project.

The project is developed from the tutorial found [here](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-How-to-Control-a-Stepper-Motor-With-L293D-/)
